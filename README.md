## Introduction

In this project, we aim to create a deep learning model capable of classifying dog images into different categories. The primary focus is on understanding the process of data preprocessing, building a TensorFlow model, and evaluating its performance.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Checking**: The initial step involves checking whether all the image paths listed in the provided CSV file actually correspond to existing image files.

2. **Label Conversion**: The labels present in the data are converted into a numpy array for further processing.

3. **Boolean Label Conversion**: Each label is transformed into a Boolean array, which is a common practice in multi-class classification tasks.

4. **Data Setup**: The data is divided into two variables: `x` containing filenames and `y` containing boolean labels.

5. **Data Split**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets with an 80-20 ratio.

6. **Image Preprocessing Function**: A function is defined to preprocess images. This function reads an image file, converts it into a numerical tensor with RGB channels, scales the color values to a range of 0-1, and resizes the image to a desired dimension (e.g., 244x244).

7. **Tuple Creation Function**: Another function is created to generate a tuple of an image and its corresponding label. This function takes an image file path and its associated label, processes the image using the preprocessing function, and returns the tuple.

8. **TensorFlow Model**: A deep learning model is constructed using TensorFlow. The architecture can be found in the notebook.

9. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The model is compiled with a specific loss and accuracy metric. It's then trained using the training dataset and evaluated on the validation set.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `dog_vision_classification.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to understand and execute each stage of the project.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. In this project, we ensure that the image data is properly prepared for model training. This includes converting labels, preprocessing images, and splitting the dataset.

## Model Creation

The model architecture used in this project can be found within the notebook. It's important to understand the layers, activations, and other components of the model to effectively train and evaluate it.

## Model Evaluation

The model is compiled with a specific loss function and accuracy metric. After training, its performance is evaluated using the validation set. The evaluation metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and whether any adjustments are needed.
